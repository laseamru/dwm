dwm
-----

dwm is an incredible lightweight and fast tiling window manager for X developed by the suckless community. The window manager is written in C and also requires the enduser to modify the code if changes are desired. Luckily there are a lot of patches written by dwm/suckless users for those that are less familiar with C.

Patches

My build of dwm is patched with the following:

- fullgaps (enable gaps between windows)
- status2d (enable colors for the statusbar)
