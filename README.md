dwm
-----

dwm is an incredible lightweight and fast tiling window manager for X developed by the [suckless](https://suckless.org/) community. The window manager is written in C and also requires the enduser to modify the code if changes are desired. Luckily there are a lot of patches written by dwm/suckless users for those that are less familiar with C.
